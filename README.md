# Go Microservice: Books, Authors & Quotes

This project is a **microservice written in Go**, following **Domain-Driven Design (DDD)** principles.  
The domain consists of three independent aggregates: `Book`, `Author`, and `Quote`.

The main idea is to keep each aggregate isolated and testable, allowing clients to consume the API in a flexible way.  
The design aims for simplicity and clarity so that any developer can easily identify the domain logic and the project layers.

## ðŸš€ Main Features
- Layered architecture (starting with the domain).
- Three main aggregates: **Book**, **Author**, **Quote**.
- Unit tests included for the domain layer.
- Ready to evolve with domain events.
